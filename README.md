For the "Glamorous spinach" file, the code creates a night sky that randomizes where the stars end up when you refresh the code.

For the "Locrain crabapple" file, the code creates rain clouds that also end up in random spots when you refresh the code. Also, the sky, clouds, and colors of the rain change color when the code is refreshed. The raindrops vibrate to show that the rain is in a constant state of moving.

For the "Inexpensive chess" file, the code generates images and gifs of monkeys. The code also shows that the font, color, and stroke of the text can be changed when you edit some features.
